<h1> My Zen Garden Theme </h1>
    <p> Theme: Camp theme. My camp theme will use white text with transparent background with photos and icons and logos that are seen on a camp site. nature is the main topic of my theme. I want an endless scrollable website.   </p>
    
<h1> Mood and Atmosphere</h1>
    <p> Mood is very calming with bight text. It is suitable for all ages as i plan on using alot of icons and less texts (icons and navs) </p>
    
<h2> Colours </h2>
    <p> I want to use white for the text and icons. Other colours will be incoorporated in the photos </p>
    
<h2> Images </h2>
    <p> I will take some photos myself and also find vector photos. Using no colour in m text will challenge me to find the colours and attractions by the photos. </p>
    
<h1> Alternative Ideas </h1>
    <h3>Idea #1</h3>
    <p> Theme: Western and tattoo theme. This theme will have a canvas background using western bullets and sailor like images and borders to create the look.  </p>
    
    <h3> Idea #2   </h3>
    <p> Theme: Bubble theme. Seamless backgrounds that follows you down the page. The page will be fun and exciting and seem like a very user friendly website for all ages. Will use opacity often as part of the theme. </p>
